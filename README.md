# LuhnAlgorithm

This program is written by [Johnny Hoang](https://github.com/flaakan) and [Jesper Englund](https://github.com/englundjesper).

## Information

This program requires you to enter a number to test if it is a valid number according to Luhn's Algorithm.  
**_Note:_** this program does not handle wrong user inputs, it expects the user to enter the right input, see below for more information.

The only requirement is to seperate the last number from the rest. ex: `"139202 0"` or `"123018903921894 5"`.  

 ### Our program will then check:
* if it can be a credit card 
* if the expected value of the last number is equal to the last number provided
* if the number passes Luhn's Algorithm.
